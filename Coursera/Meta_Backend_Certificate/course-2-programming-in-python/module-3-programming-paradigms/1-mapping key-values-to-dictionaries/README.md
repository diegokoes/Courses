# Lab: Mapping key-values to Dictionary data structures

In this lab, you will use Python techniques to modify sequences using functions like `map()` and comprehensions for both lists and dictionaries. Your goal is to create usernames for employees at Little Lemon and organize employee initials and IDs in a dictionary for easy access.

### **Goal:**

Practice using Python's `map()` function and comprehensions to efficiently transform and organize data in lists and dictionaries.

### **Objectives:**

1. Use the `map()` function to apply a custom function to all elements in a list.
2. Apply list comprehension to create and format strings based on given conditions.
3. Use dictionary comprehension to create key-value mappings for organized data access.

> #### **To run your Python code**
>
> - Right-click on your Python file in the file tree and select "Run Python File in Terminal".
> - Alternatively, use the play button at the top-right of VSCode and select "Run Python File in Terminal" from the dropdown.
> - Or, follow lab instructions to run your code using `python3` commands in the terminal.

## Exercise Instructions

1. **Open the `comprehensions.py` file** under the **PROJECT** folder.

2. **Run the script**.
   - Open a terminal by navigating to `Terminal > New Terminal`.
   - Execute the following command to run the script:

     ```bash
     python3 comprehensions.py
     ```

3. **Implement the `to_mod_list()` function**.
   - Use the `map()` function to apply the `mod()` function to each element in `employee_list`.
   - Store the result in a variable called `map_emp`, convert it to a list, and return it.
   - **Note:** The `mod()` function formats each entry as `name_department`, for example, `"Lisa_Cold Storage"`.

4. **Implement the `generate_usernames()` function**.  
   - Use list comprehension and the `replace()` method to replace spaces with underscores (`_`) in `mod_list`.
   - Return the modified list of usernames.

5. **Implement the `map_id_to_initial()` function**.  
   - Use dictionary comprehension to map each employee's ID to the first letter of their name.
   - The resulting dictionary should use initials as keys and IDs as values.
